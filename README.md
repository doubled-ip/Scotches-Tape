# Context
I'm a scotch whiskey enthusiast. I like to find and collect specific bottles.

However, in Canada and particularly in Quebec, alcohols (spirits) must be purchased from the government and in Quebec it is from the SAQ "Societe des alcools du Quebec".

It's like a liquor store except: 
- it's centralized;
- it's managed by the government;
- employees are unionized public servants;
- prices are thus boosted;

# Problem
Can't buy online directly from distilleries. No transparency on when stocks will be available and where.
