# Scotches-Tape
Extract data and monitor prices and availability. Set alerts on desired items. Potentially automatically order products.

# Context
I'm a scotch whiskey enthusiast. I like to find and collect specific bottles.

However, in Canada and particularly in Quebec, spirits must be purchased from the government from the SAQ "Societe des alcools du Quebec".

It's like a liquor store except: 
- it's centralized;
- it's managed by the government;
- prices are thus boosted;
- bureaucracy;

# Problem
Can't buy online directly from distilleries in Quebec. No transparency on when stocks will be available and where. 

# Solution
